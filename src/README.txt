Wildlife Acoustics, Inc. is pleased to offer source code for decoding our
proprietary WAC audio files produced by some of our bioacoustics recorders
including our SM1, SM2, SM2+, SM2BAT192x2, SM2BAT384, SM2BAT+, SM3, SM3BAT,
EM3, and EM3+.

Our objective is to give our customers and third-party developers the ability
to decode WAC files and create value-added solutions.  Details about the file
format can be found in the comments in wac2wavcmd.c.  A Makefile is provided
for convenience and should work on most Unix systems including Linux.

We hope you find this useful!
